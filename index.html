          According to all known laws
          of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body
          off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.
          Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little.
          Barry! Breakfast is ready! Coming! Hang on a second. Hello? Barry? Adam? Can you believe this is happening? I
          can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I'm
          excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud.

          Once upon a time there was a lovely princess. But she had an enchantment upon her of a fearful sort, which
          could only be broken by Love's first kiss. She was locked away in a castle guarded by a terrible fire
          breathing dragon. Many brave knights had attempted to free her from this dreadful prison, but none prevailed.
          She waited in the dragon's keep in the highest room of the tallest tower for her true love and true love's
          first kiss. Like that's ever going to happen. What a loony. Shrek Beware Stay out I think he's in here. All
          right. Lets get it! Hold on. Do you know what that thing can do to you? Yeah. He'll groan into your bones for
          his brains. Well actually that would be a giant. Now Ogres, huh, they are much worse. They'll make a soup from
          your freshly peeled skin. They'll chew your livers, squeeze the jelly from your eyes. Actually, it's quite
          good on toast. Back, back beast, back! I warned you! Right. This is the part, where you run away. Yeah! And
          stay out.

          Own a musket for home defense, since that's what the founding fathers intended. Four ruffians break into my
          house. "What the devil?" As I grab my powdered wig and Kentucky rifle. Blow a golf ball sized hole through the
          first man, he's dead on the spot. Draw my pistol on the second man, miss him entirely because it's smoothbore
          and nails the neighbors dog. I have to resort to the cannon mounted at the top of the stairs loaded with grape
          shot, "Tally ho lads" the grape shot shreds two men in the blast, the sound and extra shrapnel set off car
          alarms. Fix bayonet and charge the last terrified rapscallion. He Bleeds out waiting on the police to arrive
          since triangular bayonet wounds are impossible to stitch up. Just as the founding fathers intended.
